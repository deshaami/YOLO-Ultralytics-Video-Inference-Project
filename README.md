# YOLOv11 Video Inference with Ultralytics

This project demonstrates how to use the Ultralytics YOLOv11 models to perform various computer vision tasks on videos, including object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, classification, and oriented bounding box detection. The provided code downloads input videos (primarily for Google Colab), runs inference using multiple pretrained YOLOv11 models on these videos, saves the prediction outputs, converts them to a widely supported video format, and displays the results.

The workflow covers setting up the environment, loading different YOLOv11 model variants, running predictions on sample videos, and handling output video processing for easy viewing. This end-to-end pipeline enables efficient video analysis using the latest YOLOv11 models without diving into individual implementation details, all ready to run in a Colab or similar environment.
